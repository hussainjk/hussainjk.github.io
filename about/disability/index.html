    <p>I am almost completely blind from birth, due to a genetic disorder known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leber_congenital_amaurosis">LCA.</a>
My vision is limited to light levels and silhouettes of large objects,
and there are a variety of resources I use to compensate for this.
The most important of these being, of course, my own resourcefulness.</p>
<h2 id="screen-reader">Screen Reader</h2>
<p>A screen reader is a piece of software which uses synthesized speech to read aloud the contents of computer applications.
I interact with the computer using the keyboard, and the screen reader then provides different kinds of spoken feedback;
such as the word I typed, the line of text I moved to, the menu I opened, and so-on.
In particular, I am a Linux user, and I use the screen readers <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/Orca">Orca</a> for graphical applications and <a href="http://www.linux-speakup.org/">Speakup</a> for the console.
There are also similar applications for smartphones, and I use <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.marvin.talkback">TalkBack</a> for Android.</p>
<p>This is what I use for most of my day-to-day activities, so it&rsquo;s become second-nature to me over the many years.
I can read at 1,000 words a minute, which I&rsquo;m very proud of.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in order to function properly, screen reading technology depends on applications to implement the right accessibility standards and infrastructure.
This is very often not the case, and modern web apps and pages tend to be especially guilty of such violations.</p>
<h2 id="braille">Braille</h2>
<p>Braille is a tactile writing system for the blind.
A braille glyph is made up of six dots in two columns of three, each of which can be raised or lowered.
Glyphs are then evenly spaced and organized into rows.
Braille text is produced on thick paper, by punching holes in the back of the paper to raise the dots.</p>
<p>Alternatively, refreshable Braille displays are electromechanical devices which display one line of Braille at a time,
by raising and lowering round pins representing dots through a metal grid.
They are generally used in combination with a screen reader, which sends them the text to display from the computer.</p>
<p>Although I like and use both Braille books and Braille displays, I prefer screen readers for the most part,
because Braille is cumbersome and much slower to use.</p>
<p>There are many Braille encodings, but the ones I primarily use are <a href="http://www.brailleauthority.org/literary/ebae2002.pdf">English contracted Braille</a> and the <a href="https://www.prcvi.org/media/1155/nemeth-code-mathematics-science-notation-1972-revision.pdf">Nemeth</a> encoding for mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="math">Math</h2>
<p>Screen reading technology generally doesn&rsquo;t have good support for math content in PDF documents.
I usually have to read math texts in <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> source, which is much more accessible because it is a text-based format.
In particular, Wikipedia and the <a href="https://ncatlab.org/">nLab</a> are great resources, because you can always read articles in source form,
and <a href="https://arxiv.org/">ArXiv</a> usually lets you download sources.</p>
<h2 id="programming">Programming</h2>
<p>Programming is about as accessible a pursuit as you can get, since all you need is access to a text editor and a terminal,
both of which are very well-supported by screen readers.
My screen reader indicates indentation levels and  punctuation, which I use to navigate around source code files.
My workflow is otherwize mostly the same as that of a sighted developer.</p>
<h2 id="guide-dog">Guide Dog</h2>
<p>I use a guide dog to help me travel. She is trained in following relative directions, avoiding obstacles and other pedestrians, stopping at curbs,
and many other small things that nonetheless help keep me safe on the road.
She wears a black leather harness when she is working, to identify her as a service animal.
You should <strong>never interact with service animals when they are working</strong>.
They are not machines, so it will cause them to get distracted, and this will jeopardize the safety of their owner.</p>
<p>You can find out more about my guide dog <a href="../../about/otter/">on her own page.</a></p>
