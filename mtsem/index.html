      <h1>Learning Seminar On Mirror Theory</h1>
    </header>

    <p>We are running an online learning seminar at the University of Toronto on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/mirror+symmetry">mirror symmetry,</a> aimed at undergraduate students.</p>
<h2 id="organization">organization</h2>
<p>The seminar is being lead by <em>Waleed Qaisar</em>.
We meet <em>every Monday at 10:30 am</em> on <a href="https://utoronto.zoom.us/j/95720051155">zoom</a>.
If you would like to join, then please <a href="mailto:waleed.qaisar@mail.utoronto.ca">contact Waleed</a> for the meeting password.</p>
<h2 id="outline">Outline</h2>
<p>We will start by following <a href="https://www.claymath.org/library/monographs/cmim01c.pdf">this Clay monograph by Hori et al.</a>
The initial aim will be to finish Part 2 as quickly as possible, but not quicker. Even if this is the only thing we do, we should be able to declare the seminar a success.</p>
<p>Depending on how this goes, there is a plan to start another (disjoint), more advanced seminar on <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/automorphic+form">Automorphic Forms,</a> <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Shimura+variety">Shimura Varieties,</a> and <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Langlands+program">the Langlands program.</a></p>
<p>The tentative plan is to start with Part 2, Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 of the Clay Proceedings monograph. Please read the introduction before Part 1, and Chapter 8 (and if possible, 9) of Part 2 before the first session. It would be good to acquaint yourself with the relevant mathematical structures coming up here, namely <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/vector+bundle">vector bundles</a>, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/principal+bundle">principal bundles</a>, <a href="https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/connection">connections</a>, etc. Besides using the same monograph, you may like the &ldquo;Bundles and Connections&rdquo; chapter of <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/worldscibooks/10.1142/2324">Gauge Theories, Knots and Gravity,&rdquo; by John Baez.</a> If you are familiar with manifolds and differential forms, you can probably gain enough through a casual read to suffice for the first meeting.</p>
<h2 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h2>
<p>There are no prerequisites from the physical side, but it might be good to read some introductory quantum mechanics beforehand.
We might try to cover most of the mathematical prerequisites. You should probably know what a manifold is, but you can prepare by casually reading the first chapter of the monograph above. This might change depending on how the first meeting goes. (People who are well acquainted with complex algebraic geometry should not worry they will be bored - we might begin with Part 2 and refer back to Part 1 as required.)</p>
<h2 id="sessions">sessions</h2>
<h3 id="week-1---monday-august-31">Week 1 - Monday August 31</h3>
<p>The tentative plan is to start with Part 2, Chapter 8 and Chapter 9 of the Clay Proceedings monograph.

<h3 id="week-2---sunday-september-7">Week 2 - Sunday September 7</h3>
<p>We will be going through chapter 9 of the monograph.</p>
<h2 id="additional-resources">Additional Resources</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://dms.umontreal.ca/~cornea/LagTopResourcePage.html">These lecture notes on Lagrangian topology</a> from a course at the University of Montreal, for those who may be interested in homological side of mirror symmetry.</li>
